# multicluster-runtime

<img src="./contrib/logo/logo.png" width="300"/>

## Multi cluster controllers with controller-runtime

- **no fork, no go mod replace**: clean extension to [upstream controller-runtime](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime).
- **universal**: kind, [cluster-api](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api), [Gardener](https://gardener.cloud/) (tbd), kcp (WIP), BYO. Cluster providers make the controller-runtime multi-cluster aware.
- **seamless**: add multi-cluster support without compromising on single-cluster. Run in either mode without code changes to the reconcilers. 

## Uniform Reconcilers

Run the same reconciler against many clusters:
- The reconciler reads from cluster A and writes to cluster A.
- The reconciler reads from cluster B and writes to cluster B.
- The reconciler reads from cluster C and writes to cluster C.

This is the most simple case. Many existing reconcilers can easily adapted to work like this without major code changes. The resulting controllers will work in the multi-cluster setting, but also in the classical single-cluster setup, all in the same code base.

## Multi-Cluster-aware Reconcilers

Run reconcilers that listen to some cluster(s) and operate other clusters.

## Principles

1. multicluster-runtime is a friendly extension of controller-runtime.
2. multicluster-runtime loves ❤️ contributions.
3. multicluster-runtime is following controller-runtime releases.
4. multicluster-runtime is developed as if it was part of controller-runtime (quality standards, naming, style).
5. multicluster-runtime could be a testbed for native controller-runtime functionality, eventually becoming superfluous.
6. multicluster-runtime is provider agnostic, but may contain providers with its own go.mod files and dedicated OWNERS files.

## How it looks?

```golang
package main

import (
	"context"
	"log"

	corev1 "k8s.io/api/core/v1"
	apierrors "k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/api/errors"

	ctrl "sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime"
	"sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/manager"
	"sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/manager/signals"
	"sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/reconcile"

	mcbuilder "sigs.k8s.io/multicluster-runtime/pkg/builder"
	mcmanager "sigs.k8s.io/multicluster-runtime/pkg/manager"
	mcreconcile "sigs.k8s.io/multicluster-runtime/pkg/reconcile"
	"sigs.k8s.io/multicluster-runtime/providers/kind"
)

func main() {
	ctx := signals.SetupSignalHandler()

	provider := kind.New()
	mgr, err := mcmanager.New(ctrl.GetConfigOrDie(), provider, manager.Options{})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err, "unable to create manager")
	}

	err = mcbuilder.ControllerManagedBy(mgr).
		Named("multicluster-configmaps").
		For(&corev1.ConfigMap{}).
		Complete(mcreconcile.Func(
			func(ctx context.Context, req mcreconcile.Request) (ctrl.Result, error) {
				cl, err := mgr.GetCluster(ctx, req.ClusterName)
				if err != nil {
					return reconcile.Result{}, err
				}

				cm := &corev1.ConfigMap{}
				if err := cl.GetClient().Get(ctx, req.Request.NamespacedName, cm); err != nil {
					if apierrors.IsNotFound(err) {
						return reconcile.Result{}, nil
					}
					return reconcile.Result{}, err
				}

				log.Printf("ConfigMap %s/%s in cluster %q", cm.Namespace, cm.Name, req.ClusterName)

				return ctrl.Result{}, nil
			},
		))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err, "unable to create controller")
	}

	go provider.Run(ctx, mgr)
	if err := mgr.Start(ctx); err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err, "unable to run manager")
	}
}
```

## FAQ

### How is it different from https://github.com/admiraltyio/multicluster-controller ?

In contrast to https://github.com/admiraltyio/multicluster-controller, multicluster-runtime keeps building on controller-runtime for most of its constructs. It is not replacing the manager, the controller or the cluster. To a large degree, this became possible through the extensive use of generics in controller-runtime. Most multicluster-runtime constructs are just type instantiations with a little glue.

### Can I dynamically load provider plugins?

No, plugins are out of scope for now. Multicluster-runtime needs source code changes to 
1. enable multi-cluster support by replacing some controller-runtime imports with the multicluster-runtime equivalents and
2. wire supported providers.
The provider interface is simple. So it is not ruled out to have some plugin mechanism in the future.
